* sounds
A collection of sounds used daily in my ArchLinux config.

** Installation
*** on ArchLinux
one can use [[https://github.com/a2n-s/pkgbuilds/blob/main/x86_64/a2n-s-sounds-git/PKGBUILD][my custom PKGBUILD]] as follows:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/a2n-s/pkgbuilds
cd ./pkgbuilds
./install.sh x86_64/a2n-s-sounds-git
#+end_src
*** on another distribution of Linux
/Makefile and instructions *coming soon*/
** Usage
The sounds are installed by default in ~/usr/share/sounds/a2n-s-sounds-git/~.

Try to play one of them with ~mpt --no-video /usr/share/sounds/a2n-s-sounds-git/{sound}~ for instance!
