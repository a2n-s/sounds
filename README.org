* sounds
A collection of sounds used daily in my ArchLinux config.

one can use [[https://github.com/amtoine/pkgbuilds/blob/main/x86_64/amtoine-sounds-git/PKGBUILD][my custom PKGBUILD]] as follows:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/amtoine/pkgbuilds
cd ./pkgbuilds
./install.sh x86_64/amtoine-sounds-git

The sounds are installed by default in ~/usr/share/sounds/amtoine-sounds-git/~.

Try to play one of them with ~mpt --no-video /usr/share/sounds/amtoine-sounds-git/{sound}~ for instance!
